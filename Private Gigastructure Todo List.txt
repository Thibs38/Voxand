Making the Game:

Part 1: Core
The core of the game is things like base networking and physics. Anything that will be needed later and wouldn't be wise
to create later. (Libraries, Fonts, whatever).



Part 2: The Players Core
The Player needs a few things to make it so we can infinitally build off of him without needing to add new systems later
for items, inventory, building.. so on. 



Part 3: Online Services
This is stuff like the main menu, joining the servers, chat, commands, fun stuff, groups, reporting people, admininstartion,
cheating, ect.



Part 4: AI Implementation
Here we need to do like we did for the player and make a really good core to build off of so we never have to do it again.


Part 5: World Generation
Here we need to make the core of generation so we never have to do it again and make a world to make it so players can start
playing around in the world and coming up with stuff they may want. Once this part is done we can have betas and by then
there will be some traction to the game (enough to have proper play sessions).


Part 6: The Rest
The rest of the process will be making the game feature rich and using the systems we made before to make a lot of cool shit.
